# JavaScript Gremlin Language Variant

[Apache TinkerPopâ„¢][tk] is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems
(OLAP). [Gremlin][gremlin] is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional,
data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's
property graph.

Gremlin-Javascript implements Gremlin within the JavaScript language and can be used on Node.js.

```bash
npm install gremlin
```

Please see the [reference documentation][docs] at Apache TinkerPop for more information.
